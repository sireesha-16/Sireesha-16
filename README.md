#### My Projects 
All of my projects are released as open-source on GitHub:

- [respio](https://github.com/sireesha-16/pulmonary-infection-detection): respio is a deep learning-based system designed to analyze audio recordings of respiratory sounds and classify them into different respiratory diseases. This project encompasses various stages from data collection to model deployment, providing a comprehensive solution for diagnosing respiratory ailments. An application that receives the employee’s respiratory audio as input and the trained model will analyze the audio and output what kind of infection is being affected to the employee.
- [prescripta](https://github.com/sireesha-16/prescripta): Prescripta is a web-based tool designed to extract structured medical information from handwritten prescription images. It aims to help convert scanned or photographed prescriptions into machine-readable, analyzable data — useful for digital health records, data analysis, or downstream ML workflows. It uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or handwritten-text recognition tools to extract text from images.
- [equishield](https://github.com/sireesha-16/equishield): EquiShield is an advanced Gender Bias Detection & Correction System that identifies implicit biases in news headlines and rewrites them with neutral, unbiased alternatives using machine learning, NLP, and AI-based text generation.It involves an ML-based classification with TF-IDF feature extraction, Rule-based conditioning + AI-powered text rewriting (Hugging Face), and user-friendly Streamlit-based web application
